# Enhanced HR Analytics System

## 1. Advanced KPI Framework

### 1.1 Workforce Performance KPIs

#### Productivity Metrics
```
Individual Productivity Index (IPI) = 
(Units Produced × Quality Rate) ÷ (Standard Time × Hours Worked)

Team Velocity Index = 
(Team Output ÷ Team Size) ÷ (Department Average Output ÷ Average Team Size)

Quality-Adjusted Production Rate (QAPR) =
(Total Units - Defective Units) ÷ Total Production Hours

Cost Per Unit (CPU) = 
Total Production Cost ÷ Quality-Adjusted Output

Labor Utilization Rate =
Direct Labor Hours ÷ Total Available Hours
```

#### Efficiency Metrics
```
Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) =
Availability × Performance × Quality

Process Efficiency Ratio =
Value-Added Time ÷ Total Production Time

Resource Utilization Index =
Actual Resource Usage ÷ Planned Resource Allocation

Downtime Impact Rate =
(Downtime Hours × Hourly Production Rate) ÷ Total Possible Output
```

### 1.2 Training & Development KPIs

#### Learning Effectiveness
```
Skill Application Rate =
(Tasks Completed Using New Skills ÷ Total Tasks) × 100

Certification Success Rate =
(Certifications Achieved ÷ Certifications Attempted) × 100

Performance Improvement Delta =
[(Post-Training Performance - Pre-Training Performance) ÷ Pre-Training Performance] × 100

Knowledge Transfer Index =
(Peer Training Sessions Conducted ÷ Training Sessions Attended) × 100
```

#### Training Investment
```
Training ROI = 
[(Performance Value Increase - Training Cost) ÷ Training Cost] × 100

Skill Gap Closure Rate =
(Skills Acquired ÷ Identified Skill Gaps) × 100

Learning Path Completion Rate =
(Completed Learning Milestones ÷ Total Planned Milestones) × 100
```

### 1.3 Attendance & Compliance KPIs

#### Time Management
```
On-Time Start Rate =
(On-Time Starts ÷ Total Shifts) × 100

Schedule Adherence =
(Actual Working Time ÷ Scheduled Working Time) × 100

Break Compliance Rate =
(Compliant Break Times ÷ Total Break Times) × 100
```

#### Overtime Analysis
```
Overtime Ratio =
Overtime Hours ÷ Regular Hours

Overtime Cost Impact =
(Overtime Hours × Overtime Rate) ÷ Total Labor Cost

Overtime Distribution Index =
Standard Deviation of Overtime Hours Across Teams
```
