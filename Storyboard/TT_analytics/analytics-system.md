# Advanced HR Analytics & Reporting System

## 1. Attendance & Absenteeism Analytics

### 1.1 Core Metrics
```
ATTENDANCE TRACKING FORMULAS

Bradford Factor = S² × D
Where:
S = Number of spells of absence in 52 weeks
D = Total days of absence

Absence Rate = (Total Absence Hours ÷ Total Scheduled Hours) × 100

Frequency Rate = (Number of Absence Incidents ÷ Average Number of Employees) × 100

Lost Time Rate = (Total Hours Lost to Absence ÷ Total Hours Scheduled) × 100
```

### 1.2 Pattern Analysis
- Day-of-week trending
- Seasonal patterns
- Department comparisons
- Individual vs team patterns
- Correlation with events/workload

### 1.3 Cost Impact Analysis
```
Direct Cost Impact = Absent Hours × Hourly Rate
Indirect Cost Impact = (Replacement Cost + Productivity Loss + Administrative Cost)
Total Absence Cost = Direct Cost + Indirect Cost
Cost per Employee = Total Absence Cost ÷ Number of Employees
```

## 2. Training & Development Analytics

### 2.1 Training Effectiveness
```
Training ROI = [(Benefit from Training - Training Cost) ÷ Training Cost] × 100

Skill Improvement Rate = [(Post-Training Score - Pre-Training Score) ÷ Pre-Training Score] × 100

Knowledge Retention Rate = (Post-Training Test Score ÷ Initial Test Score) × 100
```

### 2.2 Training Coverage
```
Training Completion Rate = (Completed Training ÷ Assigned Training) × 100

Skill Gap Coverage = (Skills Acquired ÷ Required Skills) × 100

Training Hours per Employee = Total Training Hours ÷ Number of Employees
```

### 2.3 Cost Analysis
```
Training Cost per Employee = Total Training Cost ÷ Number of Employees

Cost per Training Hour = Total Training Cost ÷ Total Training Hours

Training Budget Utilization = (Actual Spend ÷ Budgeted Amount) × 100
```

## 3. Labor Productivity Analytics

### 3.1 Piece Rate Productivity
```
Hourly Production Rate = Units Produced ÷ Hours Worked

Efficiency Rate = (Actual Output ÷ Standard Output) × 100

Quality Rate = (Good Units ÷ Total Units Produced) × 100

First Pass Yield = (Units Passing First Inspection ÷ Total Units) × 100
```

### 3.2 Daily Minimum Wage Compliance
```
Daily Effective Rate = Daily Earnings ÷ Hours Worked

Wage Gap Analysis = Minimum Required Daily Rate - Actual Daily Rate

Compliance Rate = (Days Meeting Minimum Wage ÷ Total Working Days) × 100
```

### 3.3 Weekly Performance Metrics
```
Weekly Target Achievement = (Actual Output ÷ Weekly Target) × 100

Rolling Performance Index = Current Week Output ÷ 4-Week Average Output

Productivity Trend = (Current Week Rate - Previous Week Rate) ÷ Previous Week Rate
```
