# Landing Page Architecture

## Overview

The landing page (`Landing.tsx`) serves as the dynamic entry point for TrackTalent, featuring role-specific content for Candidates, Employers, and Partners. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, it employs a responsive, mobile-first design approach.

  '2xl': '1536px',
};
```

## Animation Guidelines

### Transitions
- Page role switches: 300ms ease-in-out
- Feature hover states: 150ms ease
- Mobile menu: 200ms ease

### Hover States

- Feature cards: Subtle elevation
- Links: Color transition

## Performance Considerations

1. Component Lazy Loading
```typescript
const FeatureSection = lazy(() => import('./FeatureSection'));
const HeroSection = lazy(() => import('./HeroSection'));
```

2. Image Optimization
- Next-gen formats (WebP)
- Responsive images
- Lazy loading

3. Animation Performance
- Use CSS transforms
- Avoid layout shifts
- Hardware acceleration

## Accessibility

1. Semantic HTML
- Proper heading hierarchy
- ARIA labels
- Role attributes

2. Keyboard Navigation
- Focus management
- Skip links
- Visible focus states

3. Screen Readers
- Alt text
- ARIA live regions
- Descriptive labels

## Testing Considerations

1. Component Tests
- Hero section visibility
- Feature navigation
- Role switching

2. Integration Tests
- Form submissions
- Navigation flows
- Authentication states

3. Visual Regression
- Responsive layouts
- Color schemes
- Animation states

## Development Workflow

1. Component Development
- Storybook integration
- Prop documentation
- Usage examples

2. State Management
- Role selection persistence
- Form state handling
- Navigation state

3. Build Process
- Code splitting
- Asset optimization
- Performance monitoring
